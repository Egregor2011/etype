# Etype
Small javascript library for browser event prototyping

For using just add '/src/etype.js' file to your html page

List of maintained events:
- Hide/Show elements
- Toggle elements
- Link events (emulating the routing pages behavior, check up an example in test.index.html page)
- Cross events (emulates clicks on the remote links, if it needs)
- Slide events (mostly usable on landings or SPA, #href alternative)- work is still in progress, though
