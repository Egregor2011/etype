# Etype
Small javascript library for browser event prototyping

For using just add '/src/etype.js' file to your html page, then define an element(s) on the page with etype-element="{element_name}" annotation.
To define an event element use an etype-{event_name}.
For more examples, please take a look at test.index.html file in /test folder 


List of maintained events:
- Hide/Show elements
- Toggle elements
- Link events (emulating the routing pages behavior, check up an example in test.index.html page)
- Cross events (emulates clicks on the remote links, if it needs)
- Slide events (mostly usable on landings or SPA, #href alternative)
